## About Me
Hi, I'm Jaewon, a 6th-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by Professor Hyesoon Kim. 
My research focuses on computer architecture, specifically optimizing memory safety mechanisms for GPUs through hardware/software co-design.
I also have over five years of experience as an SoC Performance Architect in Samsung S.LSI, where I specialized in SoC performance simulation and optimization.

## EDUCATION

## RESEARCH
** Computer Architecture with a focus on GPU and security **
- Proposed the first hardware-software co-designed GPU memory safety mechanism.
- Leveraged LLVM static-time analysis for kernel buffer identification and metadata access minimization.
- Designed runtime library support for secure, dynamic bounds table management.
- Hardware runtime bounds checking using a two-level bounds cache and min-max address coalescing.

## Work Experience
**SoC Performance Architect**, Samsung S.LSI -- S.Korea, Sep 2014 – Aug 2019
- Led pre-silicon performance simulation and optimization for SoC architecture, with a focus on system parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
- Designed traffic generators to model memory access patterns for multimedia IPs, improving simulation accuracy.
- Optimized Network-on-Chip (NoC) reorder buffer size by analyzing real-time memory access patterns of manager IPs, reducing NoC area by 11%.
- Enhanced an in-house cycle-accurate simulator by implementing Transaction-level Modeling (TLM) synchronization, significantly speeding up simulation performance.
- Conducted post-silicon power and performance characterization on ARM-based Linux/Android platforms using benchmarks such as SPEC2017 and CoreMark, along with tools like ADB and NI DAQ.
